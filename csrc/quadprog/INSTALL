To build the library simply go through the ./configure; make; make install cycle.

In order to use it, you will be required to include in your code file the "Array.hh" header, which contains a handy C++ implementation of Vector and Matrices.

If you have the boost library installed (http://www.boost.org), you could leverage the boost ublas vector / matrix implementation. In that case, a version of the library for ublas will also be built.
